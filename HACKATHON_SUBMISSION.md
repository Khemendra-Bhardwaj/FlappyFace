# 🐦 Flappy Bird Emotion Game - Hackathon Submission

## 🎯 Project Summary

**Flappy Bird Emotion Game** is an innovative web application that combines authentic Flappy Bird game mechanics with cutting-edge machine learning technology. The project demonstrates the integration of a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for real-time facial emotion recognition with the classic Flappy Bird game, creating the first emotion-responsive Flappy Bird experience.

### 🏆 Key Innovation
This is the **first Flappy Bird game** to use real-time facial emotion detection for dynamic difficulty adjustment, creating a truly personalized gaming experience that adapts to the player's emotional state. We've recreated the authentic Flappy Bird game mechanics while adding cutting-edge emotion recognition technology.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Judges)

### One-Command Deployment
```bash
# Clone and run
git clone <repository-url>
cd flappy-bird-emotion-game
./start.sh

# Open browser to: http://localhost:3000
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies and run
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Allow camera access** when prompted
2. **Press SPACE** to start the game
3. **Press SPACE** to flap the bird upward
4. **Navigate through pipes** by timing your flaps
5. **Watch the difficulty change** based on your emotions!

### Emotion-Based Difficulty
- 😊 **Happy** = Slightly harder (you're engaged!)
- 😢 **Sad** = Easier (supportive gameplay)
- 😠 **Angry** = Much easier (reduce frustration!)
- 😨 **Fear** = Easier (gentle encouragement)
- 😐 **Neutral** = Normal difficulty

### Flappy Bird Difficulty Parameters
- **Gap Size**: Wider gaps = easier, narrower gaps = harder
- **Pipe Speed**: Slower pipes = easier, faster pipes = harder
- **Gravity**: Weaker gravity = easier, stronger gravity = harder
- **Jump Power**: Stronger jumps = easier, weaker jumps = harder
- **Pipe Spacing**: More distance = easier, less distance = harder
